        <h1>hola</h1>

        <p> <span class="negrita">STICKY FINGERS</span> have captivated audiences around the world with their infectious
            melody lines and memorable
            blend of alternative psychedelic-rock.</p>

        <p>They have released five studio albums: Caress Your Soul (2013), Land of Pleasure (2014), Westway (The
            Glitter & The Slums) (2016), Yours to Keep (2019) and Lekkerboy (2022), as well as three EPs: Helping Hand
            (2009), Extended Play (2010), and Happy Endings (2011). Their third album was the first album to debut and
            appear at number 1 on the Australian Albums Chart.</p>

        <p>Having waited years for the alternative rock band to release new music, they’re now making up for lost
            time,
            revealing tracks from their last album LEKKERBOY.</p>

        <p>The contemplative “Saves the Day” stays true to the band’s reggae-tinged sound, with it’s slow groove
            creating the perfect laid-back, mellow atmosphere, for those slow Sunday mornings. The track speaks of
            writing a song for a love interest, only to find out she doesn’t like music. But this total dealbreaker
            actually led to some goodness, with bassist Paddy Cornwall admitting how he went into an exploration of
            self-reflection and ultimately, growth.</p>

        <p>Cornwall shares, “‘Saves the Day’ is about the importance of confronting your past and coming to terms with
            it. ‘I said I’m sorry sister for the damage I have done, I said I’m sorry Mumma for what I’ve become.’”
            “My Rush” takes a darker approach, stepping outside of the band’s typical sound. Written about addiction
            during a time when singer Dylan Frost was struggling with his mental health, the band unconsciously conjured
            up an ominous and haunting song. With lyrics like, “I could wake up in the ward dripping epipens” and “this
            world is insane, believe me ‘cause I’m, I’m back from the dead,” it’s an insight into the dark times the
            band were going through.</p>

        <p>Shortly after recording the track, Frost was admitted to hospital and placed in the ICU. A clear indication
            into just how rough things had gotten. Cornwall adds, “P.S Diz came out okay he’s still nuts as ever but
            he’s here and singing like a champion on this one.”</p>

        <p>With the release of fifth album, Lekkerboy, on the horizon, Sticky Fingers are
            demonstrating their sheer strength and musicianship and finally giving their fans what they’ve been waiting
            for.</p>
