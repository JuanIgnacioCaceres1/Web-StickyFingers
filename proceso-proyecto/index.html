        <h1>GET UPDATES ON SHOWS & MUSIC</h1>
        
        <div class="parrafo1">
            <p><span class="negrita">STICKY FINGERS</span> have captivated audiences around the world with their
                infectious
                melody lines and memorable
                blend of alternative psychedelic-rock.</p>

            <p>They have released five studio albums: Caress Your Soul (2013), Land of Pleasure (2014), Westway (The
                Glitter & The Slums) (2016), Yours to Keep (2019) and Lekkerboy (2022), as well as three EPs: Helping
                Hand
                (2009), Extended Play (2010), and Happy Endings (2011). Their third album was the first album to debut
                and
                appear at number 1 on the Australian Albums Chart.</p>

            <p>Having waited years for the alternative rock band to release new music, they’re now making up for lost
                time,
                revealing tracks from their last album LEKKERBOY.</p>

            <p>The contemplative “Saves the Day” stays true to the band’s reggae-tinged sound, with it’s slow groove
                creating the perfect laid-back, mellow atmosphere, for those slow Sunday mornings. The track speaks of
                writing a song for a love interest, only to find out she doesn’t like music. But this total dealbreaker
                actually led to some goodness, with bassist Paddy Cornwall admitting how he went into an exploration of
                self-reflection and ultimately, growth.</p>

            <p>Cornwall shares, “‘Saves the Day’ is about the importance of confronting your past and coming to terms
                with
                it. ‘I said I’m sorry sister for the damage I have done, I said I’m sorry Mumma for what I’ve become.’”
                “My Rush” takes a darker approach, stepping outside of the band’s typical sound. Written about addiction
                during a time when singer Dylan Frost was struggling with his mental health, the band unconsciously
                conjured
                up an ominous and haunting song. With lyrics like, “I could wake up in the ward dripping epipens” and
                “this
                world is insane, believe me ‘cause I’m, I’m back from the dead,” it’s an insight into the dark times the
                band were going through.</p>

            <p>Shortly after recording the track, Frost was admitted to hospital and placed in the ICU. A clear
                indication
                into just how rough things had gotten. Cornwall adds, “P.S Diz came out okay he’s still nuts as ever but
                he’s here and singing like a champion on this one.”</p>

            <p>With the release of fifth album, Lekkerboy, on the horizon, Sticky Fingers are
                demonstrating their sheer strength and musicianship and finally giving their fans what they’ve been
                waiting
                for.</p>
